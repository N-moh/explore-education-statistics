For these subjects, the proportion of pupils entering continues to increase.  \\n\\n In 2018, 68.0% of the cohort entered the new combined science pathway rather than the individual science subjects like Chemistry, Biology, Physics or Computer Science.

This was driven by small increases in entries across the majority of prior attainment groups for geography, and small increases in entries for pupils with low and average prior attainment for history. In history, the slight increase in entries from pupils with low and average prior attainment groups was counter-balanced by continued decreases in proportion of entries for high prior attainers.

This decrease in entries for pupils with high prior attainment between 2018 and 2017 is much smaller than the drop that occurred between 2016 and 2017. Some of this drop can be explained by pupils who entered a language qualification early in a subject that was subsequently reformed in 2018.

For example, changes in Attainment 8 may have been affected by the introduction of further reformed GCSEs graded on the 9-1 scale which have a higher maximum score than unreformed GCSEs. Similarly, in 2016 there were significant changes to the Attainment in English and Maths measure. \\n\\nThese results cover state-funded schools but results for all schools are available in the supporting tables and show slightly lower performance across all headline measures on average. Differences between the figures for all schools and state-funded schools are primarily due to the impact of unapproved and unregulated qualifications such as international GCSEs taken more commonly in independent schools. These qualification are not included in school performance tables. \\n\\nThere are five primary headline measures used throughout this report: \\n * **Attainment8** - measures the average achievement of pupils in up to 8 qualifications (including English and Maths). \\n * **Attainment in English & Maths (9-5)** - measures the percentage of pupils achieving a grade 5 or above in both English and maths.\\n * **EBacc Entries** – measure the percentage of pupils reaching the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) attainment threshold in core academic subjects at key stage 4. The EBacc is made up of English, maths, science, a language, and history or geography. \\n * **EBacc Average Point Score (APS)** – measures pupils’ point scores across the five pillars of the EBacc, ensuring the attainment of all pupils is recognised. New measure from 2018, replacing the previous threshold EBacc attainment measure. \\n * **Progress** - measures the progress a pupil makes from the end of key stage 2 to the end of key stage 4. It compares pupils’ Attainment 8 score with the average for all pupils nationally who had a similar starting point.

This was driven by small increases in entries across the majority of prior attainment groups for geography, and small increases in entries for pupils with low and average prior attainment for history. In history, the slight increase in entries from pupils with low and average prior attainment groups was counter-balanced by continued decreases in proportion of entries for high prior attainers.

This decrease in entries for pupils with high prior attainment between 2018 and 2017 is much smaller than the drop that occurred between 2016 and 2017.
