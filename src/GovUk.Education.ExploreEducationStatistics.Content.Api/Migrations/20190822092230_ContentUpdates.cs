The pupil's attendance on the Wednesday would be\\n  recorded separately by the other provider.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Exclusions sessions are not recorded for the days when the pupil is attending\\n  an approved educational activity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for six sessions starting on a\\n  Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which\\n  they're not excluded.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  The pupil in this situation would be excluded from the school for sessions on\\n  Wednesday, Friday and Monday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Days on which there's a planned school closure do not count towards an\\n  exclusion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for four sessions\\n  starting on a Friday but the school is planned to be closed on the Monday for\\n  an INSET day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n  Therefore the pupil's exclusion should include the two sessions on the\\n  following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"section4-4-5\\\">4.4.5 In care and SEN indicators</h4>\\n<p>\\n  For each exclusion, the pupil's in care status and SEN provision at the time\\n  of exclusion is recorded.
