For example, changes in Attainment 8 may have been affected by the introduction of further reformed GCSEs graded on the 9-1 scale which have a higher maximum score than unreformed GCSEs. Similarly, in 2016 there were significant changes to the Attainment in English and Maths measure. \\nThese results cover state-funded schools but results for all schools are available in the supporting tables and show slightly lower performance across all headline measures on average. Differences between the figures for all schools and state-funded schools are primarily due to the impact of unapproved and unregulated qualifications such as international GCSEs taken more commonly in independent schools. These qualification are not included in school performance tables. \\nThere are five primary headline measures used throughout this report: \\n * **Attainment8** - measures the average achievement of pupils in up to 8 qualifications (including English and Maths). \\n * **Attainment in English & Maths (9-5)** - measures the percentage of pupils achieving a grade 5 or above in both English and maths.\\n * **EBacc Entries** – measure the percentage of pupils reaching the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) attainment threshold in core academic subjects at key stage 4. The EBacc is made up of English, maths, science, a language, and history or geography. \\n * **EBacc Average Point Score (APS)** – measures pupils’ point scores across the five pillars of the EBacc, ensuring the attainment of all pupils is recognised. New measure from 2018, replacing the previous threshold EBacc attainment measure. \\n * **Progress** - measures the progress a pupil makes from the end of key stage 2 to the end of key stage 4. It compares pupils’ Attainment 8 score with the average for all pupils nationally who had a similar starting point. Progress 8 is a relative measure, therefore the national average Progress 8 score for mainstream schools is very close to zero. \"}]},{\"Order\":3,\"Heading\":\"Schools meeting the coasting and floor standard\",\"Caption\":\"Over 250 schools failed to support pupils to fulfil their potential in 2018\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"DataBlock\",\"Heading\":\"There is wide variation in the percentage of schools meeting the coasting and floor standard by region\",\"DataQuery\":null,\"Charts\":null,\"Summary\":null},{\"Type\":\"MarkDownBlock\",\"Body\":\"The floor and coasting standards give measures of whether schools are helping pupils to fulfil their potential based on progress measures.

This is to be expected due to changes to reformed GCSEs in 2018, meaning more points are available for higher scores.  \\nDue to changes in performance measures over time, comparability over time is complicated. As such, for disadvantaged pupils is recommended to use to disadvantage gap index instead with is more resilient to changes in grading systems over time.

For these subjects, the proportion of pupils entering continues to increase.  \\n In 2018, 68.0% of the cohort entered the new combined science pathway rather than the individual science subjects like Chemistry, Biology, Physics or Computer Science. The general pattern is for pupils with higher prior attainment tend to take single sciences; those with lower prior attainment to opt for the combined science pathway; and those with the lowest prior attainment to take no science qualifications. \\n ### Humanities \\nThe proportion of pupils entering EBacc humanities continued to increase in 2018, to 78.3% in state-funded schools, a rise of 1.5 percentage points since 2017. This was driven by small increases in entries across the majority of prior attainment groups for geography, and small increases in entries for pupils with low and average prior attainment for history. In history, the slight increase in entries from pupils with low and average prior attainment groups was counter-balanced by continued decreases in proportion of entries for high prior attainers. This trend has continued since 2016. \\n ### Languages \\n Entries to EBacc languages continued to decrease in 2018 to 46.1%, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2017. This was the fourth year in a row that entries have fallen. There were decreases across the majority of prior attainment bands but the largest drop occurred for pupils with higher prior attainment.. This decrease in entries for pupils with high prior attainment between 2018 and 2017 is much smaller than the drop that occurred between 2016 and 2017. Some of this drop can be explained by pupils who entered a language qualification early in a subject that was subsequently reformed in 2018. This was the case for over 3,500 pupils, whose language result did not count in 2018 performance tables.  \\n ### Art and design subjects \\n The percentage of pupils entering at least one arts subject decreased in 2018, by 2.2 percentage points compared to equivalent data in 2017. 44.3% of pupils in state-funded schools entered at least one arts subject. This is the third consecutive year that a fall in entries has occurred. \"}]},{\"Order\":8,\"Heading\":\"Schools performance\",\"Caption\":\"Across state-funded schools performance is typically higher in converter academies, the most common school type\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"DataBlock\",\"Heading\":\"Across state-funded schools performance is typically higher in converter academies, the most common school type\",\"DataQuery\":null,\"Charts\":null,\"Summary\":null},{\"Type\":\"MarkDownBlock\",\"Body\":\"Schools in England can be divided into state-funded and independent schools (funded by fees paid by attendees).
