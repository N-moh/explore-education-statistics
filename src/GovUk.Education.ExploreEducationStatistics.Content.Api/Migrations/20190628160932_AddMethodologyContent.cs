Methodology\",\"Caption\":\"\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"HtmlBlock\",\"Body\":\"<h3 id=\\\"section3-1\\\">3.1 Collection and cleaning of the data</h3>\\n<p>Secondary and primary data were gathered from local authorities (LAs) at pupil level, with a record for each\\n    applicant for a school place.</p>\\n<p>This data has been aggregated by DfE into the local authority level figures provided in this release.</p>\\n<p>The data collected is the position as at the respective national offer day. It includes all offers made on that\\n    day, regardless of whether they were subsequently accepted or refused.</p>\\n<p>Cleaning of the data prior to aggregation may cause slight differences between the figures contained in this\\n    publication and any released by the LAs themselves closer to the respective national offer days.</p>\\n<p>In some cases an application was recorded by both the home authority (to whom the application was made) and also\\n    by the LA within which the school where a place was offered is based.</p>\\n<p>To be correct, only the home authority to whom the applicant sent their form should record the application and\\n    offer. Therefore the duplicate record submitted by the LA in which the school is based has been removed.</p>\\n<p>Applications listing preferences or offers to schools which could not be identified from the school census,\\n    <!-- --> <a href=\\\"https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/\\\">Get Information About Schools</a> <!-- -->or\\n    via one of the additional 'dummy' school codes used to identify new schools or split entries (see below) were\\n    removed.</p>\\n<p>Other very small adjustments have been made as required to the source data to ensure that we provide as full and\\n    accurate a picture of the application and offer process as possible (for example, removing the second example if\\n    two offers have been recorded for one applicant, causing double-counting).</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-2\\\">3.2 Interpretation of the figures</h3>\\n<p>The figures are based on the offers sent out by LAs on the respective national offer days.</p>\\n<p>The final numbers of pupils starting in specific schools is likely to be different due to late applicants,\\n    refusal of offers, subsequent offers made via a second offer round or via the schools' waiting lists, or\\n    successful appeals. Revised figures incorporating any subsequent changes are not collected or published.</p>\\n<p>The inclusion of a school by an applicant as one of their preferences does not mean that they meet the admissions\\n    criteria for that school.</p>\\n<p>Examples of where the applicant has little or no chance of being admitted on national offer day include naming a\\n    selective school having not passed the grammar entrance test, living a long way out of catchment for a popular\\n    community school and requesting a place for a boy at a girls' school.</p>\\n<p>Some schools offer places via a lottery, where everyone who applies has an equal (subject to fair banding) chance\\n    of being considered, which may encourage applications.</p>\\n<p>If an authority is not able to make an offer of a preferred school, in most cases they offer a place at an\\n    alternative school.</p>\\n<p>However, some authorities chose instead to send the applicant a list of schools with available places and invite\\n    them to state which of these schools they would prefer their child to attend. These incidences are recorded as\\n    the applicant receiving no offer.</p>\\n<p>A total of five LAs made no alternative offers on secondary national offer day, to applicants to whom they were\\n    not able to make an offer of one of their preferred schools, and six made no alternative offers on primary\\n    national offer day.</p>\\n<p>The tables include the percentage of offers which are of schools a) within or b) outside the LA to which the\\n    application was made. These are calculated as a proportion of all offers, including those made to non-applicants\\n    (see table notes).</p>\\n<p>The LAs were asked not to provide data on school places offered to children with an Education, Health and Care\\n    Plan (EHC) or statement of special educational needs (SEN), since the parents of these children were not\\n    required to apply for a school place.</p>\\n<p>However, there are a number of applications where special schools were amongst the preferences stated and, in\\n    some cases, a special school has been offered.</p>\\n<p>It's assumed these are offers to SEN children who do not have a statement or EHCP. These preferences and offers\\n    have been included in the final figures.</p>\\n<p>At secondary level the application is for the main entry point into secondary school in that local authority.\\n    This is usually year 7 but a small number of authorities have a main entry point in year 9 and this is what they\\n    report on.</p>\\n<p>For LAs with more than one entry point, the intake with the largest number of places available is the one\\n    reported.</p>\\n<p>Places at schools such as UTCs and studio schools, whose intake is in year 10 (at age 14 years) are not allocated\\n    via the co-ordinated admissions process and therefore are not included in these figures.</p>\\n<p>Some schools have two entry routes. At primary school this is generally a school with a single school code but\\n    with two sites, each of which can be applied for separately.</p>\\n<p>At secondary level the two routes are usually either a school with day and boarding places, or a school with a\\n    number of places reserved for those passing aptitude tests (for example, in music or languages).</p>\\n<p>In these cases, parents can apply for both routes (e.g. for both sites of a split-site primary school), so a\\n    'dummy' school code is used to identify the second option for each affected school.</p>\\n<p>All mainstream state-funded schools, including academies, are included in the figures.</p>\\n<p>However, new opener free schools can have a rapid set-up process and may not be ready in time to make their\\n    offers within the local authority co-ordinated exercise.</p>\\n<p>Therefore, for their first year of operation only, free schools may make offers directly and those that do so\\n    will be excluded from these figures. In their second year of operation, they must make offers within the local\\n    authority co-ordination process.</p>\\n<p>The Isles of Scilly local authority has one school which takes pupils between the ages of 3 and 16.</p>\\n<p>Parents are not required to complete an application form and there is no competition for a place at the school.\\n    Therefore this authority has been omitted from both tables as preference rates cannot be calculated.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"section3-3\\\">3.3 Further information</h3>\\n<p>This release is the latest in an annual series with releases from 2011 onwards available on<!-- --> <a\\n        href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-applications\\\">Statistics: school\\n    applications</a>statistics website.</p>\\n<p>However, information on primary level preferences is only included from 2014 onwards.</p>\\n<p>This is when DfE started collecting data on primary applications and offers, based on the newly introduced\\n    national primary offer day of 16 April (or next working day).</p>\"}]},{\"Order\":4,\"Heading\":\"4.

id=\\\"section4-4-3\\\">4.4.3 Start date of exclusion</h4>\\n<p>Each exclusion is reported with a start date. This start date should reflect the date the exclusion starts - ie\\n    the date the pupil was asked to leave the school by the headteacher.</p><h4 id=\\\"section4-4-4\\\">4.4.4 Length of\\n    exclusion in sessions</h4>\\n<p>For each fixed-period and lunchtime exclusion, the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect\\n    is recorded.</p>\\n<p>For fixed-period exclusions, each session counts as half a school day. For lunchtime exclusions, each lunchtime\\n    for which the exclusion applies counts as one session.</p>\\n<p>Exclusion only covers the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school.</p>\\n<p>A fixed-period exclusion can be discontinuous which means there can be days between the start and finish dates of\\n    the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>\\n<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the days when they would have been\\n    attending the other establishment.</p>\\n<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for six sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with\\n    another provider on the Wednesday from which they have not been excluded.</p>\\n<p>Therefore, the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The pupil's\\n    attendance on the Wednesday would be recorded separately by the other provider.</p>\\n<p>Exclusions sessions are not recorded for the days when the pupil is attending an approved educational\\n    activity.</p>\\n<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for six sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil\\n    attends work experience on a Thursday from which they're not excluded.</p>\\n<p>The pupil in this situation would be excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>\\n<p>Days on which there's a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>\\n<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for four sessions starting on a Friday but the school is\\n    planned to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day.</p>\\n<p>Therefore the pupil's exclusion should include the two sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the\\n    Monday.</p><h4 id=\\\"section4-4-5\\\">4.4.5 In care and SEN indicators</h4>\\n<p>For each exclusion, the pupil's in care status and SEN provision at the time of exclusion is recorded.

present</h4>\\n<p>In <strong>spring 2006</strong> the school census started to collect enrolment level absence data on a termly\\n    basis (spring, summer and autumn collections) from maintained secondary schools, city technology colleges and\\n    academies relating to absence in the 2005/06 academic year.<!-- --> </p>\\n<p>In the <strong>spring 2007</strong> school census the scope of the collection was extended to maintained primary\\n    schools, collecting absence data for the 2006/07 academic year.</p>\\n<p>Reason for absence was also collected for the first time in the<!-- --> <strong>spring 2007</strong> school\\n    census, collecting absence by reason data for the autumn term 2006.<!-- --> </p>\\n<p>Prior to the 2016/17 academic year special schools did not provide termly absence data - instead they provided\\n    annual enrolment level absence returns.</p>\\n<p>Special school absence information was collected for the first time in the <strong>autumn 2007</strong> school\\n    census, collecting absence data for the 2006/07 academic year.</p>\\n<p>From <strong>September 2011</strong> data collection systems were amended so that the national attendance code\\n    “D” (dual registered) was no longer counted in the school census as an attendance or a possible session.</p>\\n<p>Following this, schools should only record the pupil’s attendance and absence for those sessions that a pupil was\\n    scheduled to attend at that school and the code “D” attendance code should be used to signify a session attended\\n    via the dual school.</p>\\n<p>This means that any dual registered pupils attending full time at their dual school (school B) for the period\\n    would have zero possible sessions recorded for school A.<!-- -->
