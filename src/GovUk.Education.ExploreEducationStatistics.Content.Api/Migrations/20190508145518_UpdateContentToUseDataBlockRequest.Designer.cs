Information on absence in pupil referral units, and for pupils aged four, is also included. The Department uses two key measures to monitor pupil absence – overall and persistent absence. Absence by reason and pupils characteristics is also included in this release. Figures are available at national, regional, local authority and school level. Figures held in this release are used for policy development as key indicators in behaviour and school attendance policy. Schools and local authorities also use the statistics to compare their local absence rates to regional and national averages for different pupil groups.\"}]},{\"Order\":2,\"Heading\":\"Absence rates\",\"Caption\":\"\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"MarkDownBlock\",\"Body\":\"The overall absence rate across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools increased from 4.6 per cent in 2015/16 to 4.7 per cent in 2016/17. In primary schools the overall absence rate stayed the same at 4 per cent and the rate in secondary schools increased from 5.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent. Absence in special schools is much higher at 9.7 per cent in 2016/17\\n\\nThe increase in overall absence rate has been driven by an increase in the unauthorised absence rate across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools - which increased from 1.1 per cent to 1.3 per cent between 2015/16 and 2016/17.\\n\\nLooking at longer-term trends, overall and authorised absence rates have been fairly stable over recent years after decreasing gradually between 2006/07 and 2013/14. Unauthorised absence rates have not varied much since 2006/07, however the unauthorised absence rate is now at its highest since records began, at 1.3 per cent.\\n\\nThis increase in unauthorised absence is due to an increase in absence due to family holidays that were not agreed by the school. The authorised absence rate has not changed since last year, at 3.4 per cent. Though in primary schools authorised absence rates have been decreasing across recent years.\\n\\nThe total number of days missed due to overall absence across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools has increased since last year, from 54.8 million in 2015/16 to 56.7 million in 2016/17. This partly reflects the rise in the total number of pupil enrolments, the average number of days missed per enrolment has increased very slightly from 8.1 days in 2015/16 to 8.2 days in 2016/17.\\n\\nIn 2016/17, 91.8 per cent of pupils in state-funded primary, state-funded secondary and special schools missed at least one session during the school year, this is similar to the previous year (91.7 per cent in 2015/16).\"},{\"Type\":\"DataBlock\",\"Heading\":null,\"DataBlockRequest\":{\"subjectId\":1,\"geographicLevel\":\"National\",\"countries\":null,\"localAuthorities\":null,\"regions\":null,\"startYear\":2012,\"endYear\":2017,\"filters\":[1,2],\"indicators\":[23,26,28]},\"Charts\":[{\"Indicators\":[\"23\",\"26\",\"28\"],\"XAxis\":{\"title\":\"School Year\"},\"YAxis\":{\"title\":\"Absence Rate\"},\"Type\":\"line\"}],\"Summary\":null}]},{\"Order\":3,\"Heading\":\"Persistent absence\",\"Caption\":\"\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"MarkDownBlock\",\"Body\":\"The percentage of enrolments in state-funded primary and state-funded secondary schools that were classified as persistent absentees in 2016/17 was 10.8 per cent.

Similarly, in 2016 there were significant changes to the Attainment in English and Maths measure. \\n\\nThese results cover state-funded schools but results for all schools are available in the supporting tables and show slightly lower performance across all headline measures on average. Differences between the figures for all schools and state-funded schools are primarily due to the impact of unapproved and unregulated qualifications such as international GCSEs taken more commonly in independent schools. These qualification are not included in school performance tables. \\n\\nThere are five primary headline measures used throughout this report: \\n * **Attainment8** - measures the average achievement of pupils in up to 8 qualifications (including English and Maths). \\n * **Attainment in English & Maths (9-5)** - measures the percentage of pupils achieving a grade 5 or above in both English and maths.\\n * **EBacc Entries** – measure the percentage of pupils reaching the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) attainment threshold in core academic subjects at key stage 4. The EBacc is made up of English, maths, science, a language, and history or geography. \\n * **EBacc Average Point Score (APS)** – measures pupils’ point scores across the five pillars of the EBacc, ensuring the attainment of all pupils is recognised. New measure from 2018, replacing the previous threshold EBacc attainment measure. \\n * **Progress** - measures the progress a pupil makes from the end of key stage 2 to the end of key stage 4. It compares pupils’ Attainment 8 score with the average for all pupils nationally who had a similar starting point. Progress 8 is a relative measure, therefore the national average Progress 8 score for mainstream schools is very close to zero. \"}]},{\"Order\":3,\"Heading\":\"Schools meeting the coasting and floor standard\",\"Caption\":\"Over 250 schools failed to support pupils to fulfil their potential in 2018\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"DataBlock\",\"Heading\":\"There is wide variation in the percentage of schools meeting the coasting and floor standard by region\",\"DataBlockRequest\":null,\"Charts\":null,\"Summary\":null},{\"Type\":\"MarkDownBlock\",\"Body\":\"The floor and coasting standards give measures of whether schools are helping pupils to fulfil their potential based on progress measures.

For these subjects, the proportion of pupils entering continues to increase.  \\n\\n In 2018, 68.0% of the cohort entered the new combined science pathway rather than the individual science subjects like Chemistry, Biology, Physics or Computer Science. The general pattern is for pupils with higher prior attainment tend to take single sciences; those with lower prior attainment to opt for the combined science pathway; and those with the lowest prior attainment to take no science qualifications. \\n ### Humanities \\nThe proportion of pupils entering EBacc humanities continued to increase in 2018, to 78.3% in state-funded schools, a rise of 1.5 percentage points since 2017. This was driven by small increases in entries across the majority of prior attainment groups for geography, and small increases in entries for pupils with low and average prior attainment for history. In history, the slight increase in entries from pupils with low and average prior attainment groups was counter-balanced by continued decreases in proportion of entries for high prior attainers. This trend has continued since 2016. \\n ### Languages \\n Entries to EBacc languages continued to decrease in 2018 to 46.1%, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2017. This was the fourth year in a row that entries have fallen. There were decreases across the majority of prior attainment bands but the largest drop occurred for pupils with higher prior attainment.. This decrease in entries for pupils with high prior attainment between 2018 and 2017 is much smaller than the drop that occurred between 2016 and 2017. Some of this drop can be explained by pupils who entered a language qualification early in a subject that was subsequently reformed in 2018. This was the case for over 3,500 pupils, whose language result did not count in 2018 performance tables.  \\n ### Art and design subjects \\n The percentage of pupils entering at least one arts subject decreased in 2018, by 2.2 percentage points compared to equivalent data in 2017. 44.3% of pupils in state-funded schools entered at least one arts subject.
