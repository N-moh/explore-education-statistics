Absence by reason and pupils characteristics is also included in this release. Figures are available at national, regional, local authority and school level.

Unauthorised absence rates have not varied much since 2006/07, however the unauthorised absence rate is now at its highest since records began, at 1.3 per cent.\\n\\nThis increase in unauthorised absence is due to an increase in absence due to family holidays that were not agreed by the school. The authorised absence rate has not changed since last year, at 3.4 per cent.
