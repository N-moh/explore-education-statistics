For these subjects, the proportion of pupils entering continues to increase.  \\n\\n In 2018, 68.0% of the cohort entered the new combined science pathway rather than the individual science subjects like Chemistry, Biology, Physics or Computer Science. The general pattern is for pupils with higher prior attainment tend to take single sciences; those with lower prior attainment to opt for the combined science pathway; and those with the lowest prior attainment to take no science qualifications. \\n ### Humanities \\nThe proportion of pupils entering EBacc humanities continued to increase in 2018, to 78.3% in state-funded schools, a rise of 1.5 percentage points since 2017. This was driven by small increases in entries across the majority of prior attainment groups for geography, and small increases in entries for pupils with low and average prior attainment for history. In history, the slight increase in entries from pupils with low and average prior attainment groups was counter-balanced by continued decreases in proportion of entries for high prior attainers. This trend has continued since 2016. \\n ### Languages \\n Entries to EBacc languages continued to decrease in 2018 to 46.1%, a fall of 1.3 percentage points compared to 2017. This was the fourth year in a row that entries have fallen. There were decreases across the majority of prior attainment bands but the largest drop occurred for pupils with higher prior attainment.. This decrease in entries for pupils with high prior attainment between 2018 and 2017 is much smaller than the drop that occurred between 2016 and 2017. Some of this drop can be explained by pupils who entered a language qualification early in a subject that was subsequently reformed in 2018. This was the case for over 3,500 pupils, whose language result did not count in 2018 performance tables.  \\n ### Art and design subjects \\n The percentage of pupils entering at least one arts subject decreased in 2018, by 2.2 percentage points compared to equivalent data in 2017. 44.3% of pupils in state-funded schools entered at least one arts subject. This is the third consecutive year that a fall in entries has occurred. \"}]},{\"Order\":8,\"Heading\":\"Schools performance\",\"Caption\":\"Across state-funded schools performance is typically higher in converter academies, the most common school type\",\"Content\":[{\"Type\":\"DataBlock\",\"Heading\":\"Across state-funded schools performance is typically higher in converter academies, the most common school type\",\"DataBlockRequest\":null,\"Charts\":null,\"Summary\":null,\"Tables\":null},{\"Type\":\"MarkDownBlock\",\"Body\":\"Schools in England can be divided into state-funded and independent schools (funded by fees paid by attendees).
