        Research relating to pupil absence falls into three broad categories:
        the impact of absenteeism on pupils, factors associated with
        absenteeism, and approaches to reduce absenteeism. The following is from
        a non-systematic search of the EBSCO research database, which allows for
        search and retrieval of published research from a range of different
        research journals. However, this will not represent all of the available
        research evidence relating to pupil absence.

      <h3 id="section6-1">The impact of absenteeism on pupils</h3>
      <p>
        Research has found a strong statistical link between absenteeism and
        underachievement (e.g. Gottfried 2011, 2013a; Hancock et al., 2013). For
        example, a robust study of over 20,000 pupils in Philadelphia found a
        potentially causal, detrimental negative effect of absences on both
        reading and maths achievement (Gottfried, 2013a). The effects remained
        significant even after accounting for other factors such as
        neighbourhood, teacher, classroom, and school factors. In line with
        these results, a large scale study of Australian school children
        (n=415,000) found that average academic achievement was negatively
        affected by any absence, and it continued to decline as absences
        increased (Hancock et al., 2013). Furthermore, unauthorised absences had
        a significantly stronger association with achievement than authorised
        absences, and even small amounts of unauthorised absence from school
        were associated with a fall in test scores (Hancock et al., 2013).
        Conversely, a study by Schmitt and colleagues (2013) found no
        statistically significant relationship between number of absence days
        and reading scores on a standardised test. However, the sample size in
        this study was very small (n=106).
      </p>
      <h3 id="section6-2">Factors associated with absenteeism </h3>
      <p>
        Studies have found that many contextual factors are associated with
        absenteeism. Factors discussed below include neighbourhood attributes,
        school building conditions, pupil health conditions, and grade retaining
        policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large scale US study by Gottfried (2014) indicates that the
        neighbourhood context can influence school absenteeism in urban youth.
        The results from the study show significant relationships between school
        absences and neighbourhood attributes such as poverty, family structure,
        homeownership status, and race.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Simons et al. (2010) found that building conditions in Upstate New York
        schools was also a contributing factor. An association was found between
        student absenteeism and adverse school building conditions such as
        visible mould, humidity, poor ventilation, vermin, building system or
        structural problems related to these 42 conditions. These effects were
        stronger in schools in lower socioeconomic areas and in schools attended
        by younger students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers have also investigated the impact of certain health factors,
        along with socioeconomic status. In a US-based study of 920 fourth grade
        pupils, Baxter (2011) found no statistically significant relationship
        between absenteeism and Body Mass Index or Socio-economic Status
        (operationalised as eligibility for free/reduced price school meals).
        This result does contradict other research (see for example Gottfried,
        2014, cited above), and more robust investigation may be needed to
        understand the interplay of socio-economic status and absenteeism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, a quasi-experimental study by Gottfried (2013b) examined the
        effect of retained pupils (pupils who repeat a year) on the outcomes of
        other students in the same classroom. Results showed that a greater
        percentage of retained classmates increased other students’ absence
        rates. Because the effect was only present on unexcused absences, and
        not excused absences, this suggests that grade retention increases
        disengagement levels in other students in the classroom.

      <h3 id="section6-3">Approaches to reduce absenteeism </h3>
      <p>
        Given the impacts outlined in section 6.1 of absenteeism on achievement
        in school, there is some research into approaches to reduce absenteeism.
        A literature review by Kearney and Graczyk (2014) identifies the need
        for identifying and intervening early, monitoring progress overtime,
        assessing functional behaviour, and the implementation of evidence-based
        procedures and protocols, and of team-based approaches.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Researchers have also focussed on absence due to ill health (Wilkie
        2011; 2012), and approaches to keeping those pupils in education. Wilkie
        (2012) conducted a qualitative case study of 22 senior secondary
        students and their mathematics teachers. The study found widespread
        ambiguities about educational responsibility for students during absence
        due to ill health. Teachers also demonstrated surprise in finding out
        that their students wished to continue their studies, and also a degree
        of hesitance to initiate contact with students. Students nevertheless
        expressed their desire for teachers to remain involved with them.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Wilkie (2011) discusses the potential of using online collaboration to
        allow for academic continuity for pupils with absence due to chronic ill
        health. The study finds that early data from the ‘Information and
        Communications Technology addressing educational disadvantage due to
        remoteness or prolonged absence from school’ project (Royal Children’s
        Hospital Education Institute, 2007), have demonstrated the potential of
        videoconferencing, online ‘whiteboarding’, and interactive whiteboard 43
        application sharing for pupils in this situation. The authors also
        acknowledge that this approach requires particular resources and
        infrastructures, and support for teachers.{' '}
