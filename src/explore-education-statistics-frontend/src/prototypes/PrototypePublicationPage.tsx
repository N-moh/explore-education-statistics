            This statistical first release (SFR) reports on absence of pupils of
            compulsory school age in state-funded primary, secondary and special
            schools during the 2016/17 academic year. Information on absence in
            pupil referral units, and for pupils aged four, is also included.
            The Department uses two key measures to monitor pupil absence â€“
            overall and persistent absence. Absence by reason and pupils
            characteristics is also included in this release. Figures are
            available at national, regional, local authority and school level.
            Figures held in this release are used for policy development as key
            indicators in behaviour and school attendance policy. Schools and
            local authorities also use the statistics to compare their local
            absence rates to regional and national averages for different pupil
            groups.

          <Details summary="Overall absence rate definition">
            The overall absence rate is the total number of overall absence
            sessions for all pupils as a percentage of the total number of
            possible sessions for all pupils, where overall absence is the sum
            of authorised and unauthorised absence and one session is equal to
            half a day.

          <p>
            The overall absence rate across state-funded primary, secondary and
            special schools increased from 4.6 per cent in 2015/16 to 4.7 per
            cent in 2016/17. In primary schools the overall absence rate stayed
            the same at 4 per cent and the rate in secondary schools increased
            from 5.2 per cent to 5.4 per cent. Absence in special schools is
            much higher at 9.7 per cent in 2016/17
          </p>
          <p>
            The increase in overall absence rate has been driven by an increase
            in the unauthorised absence rate across state-funded primary,
            secondary and special schools - which increased from 1.1 per cent to
            1.3 per cent between 2015/16 and 2016/17.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at longer-term trends, overall and authorised absence rates
            have been fairly stable over recent years after decreasing gradually
            between 2006/07 and 2013/14. Unauthorised absence rates have not
            varied much since 2006/07, however the unauthorised absence rate is
            now at its highest since records began, at 1.3 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>
            This increase in unauthorised absence is due to an increase in
            absence due to family holidays that were not agreed by the school.
            The authorised absence rate has not changed since last year, at 3.4
            per cent. Though in primary schools authorised absence rates have
            been decreasing across recent years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The total number of days missed due to overall absence across
            state-funded primary, secondary and special schools has increased
            since last year, from 54.8 million in 2015/16 to 56.7 million in
            2016/17. This partly reflects the rise in the total number of pupil
            enrolments, the average number of days missed per enrolment has
            increased very slightly from 8.1 days in 2015/16 to 8.2 days in
            2016/17.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016/17, 91.8 per cent of pupils in state-funded primary,
            state-funded secondary and special schools missed at least one
            session during the school year, this is similar to the previous year
            (91.7 per cent in 2015/16).
          </p>
        </AccordionSection>

        <AccordionSection heading="Persistent absence">
          <Details summary="absence definition">
            <p>
              A pupil enrolment is identified as a persistent absentee if they

            </p>
            <p>
              The persistent absentee measure changed as of the start of the
              2015/16 academic year. Time series data in this release has been
              recalculated using the new methodology but caution should be used
              when interpreting these series as they may be impacted by the
              change in the measure itself. For more information on this and on
              the methodologies used in previous years, please see the

            The percentage of enrolments in state-funded primary and
            state-funded secondary schools that were classified as persistent
            absentees in 2016/17 was 10.8 per cent. This is up from the
            equivalent figure of 10.5 per cent in 2015/16 (see Figure 2).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016/17, persistent absentees accounted for 37.6 per cent of all
            absence compared to 36.6 per cent in 2015/16. Longer term, there has
            been a decrease in the proportion of absence that persistent
            absentees account for â€“ down from 43.3 per cent in 2011/12.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall absence rate for persistent absentees across all schools
            was 18.1 per cent, nearly four times higher than the rate for all
            pupils. This is a slight increase from 2015/16, when the overall
            absence rate for persistent absentees was 17.6 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Persistent absentees account for almost a third, 31.6 per cent, of
            all authorised absence and more than half, 53.8 per cent of all
            unauthorised absence. The rate of illness absences is almost four
            times higher for persistent absentees compared to other pupils, at
            7.6 per cent and 2.0 per cent respectively.

            Illness is the main driver for overall absence rates, however whilst
            overall absence rates have increased slightly since 2015/16, illness
            rates have remained the same at 2.6 per cent. Illness absence
            accounted for 55.3 per cent of all absence in 2016/17, a lower
            proportion than seen in previous years - 57.3 in 2015/16 and 60.1 in
            2014/15.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rate of absence due to other unauthorised circumstances has
            remained the same as in 2015/16 at 0.7 per cent.

          <h3 className="govuk-heading-s">Absence due to family holiday</h3>
          <p>
            The percentage of pupils who missed at least one session due to a
            family holiday in 2016/17 was 16.9 per cent, compared with 14.7 per
            cent in 2015/16.
          </p>
          <p>
            The absence rate due to family holidays agreed by the school was 0.1
            in 2016/17, which was the same as in 2015/16. The percentage of all
            possible sessions missed due to unauthorised family holidays
            increased from 0.3 per cent in 2015/16 to 0.4 in 2016/17.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unauthorised holiday absence rates have been increasing gradually
            since 2006/07, authorised holiday absence rates are much lower now
            than in 2006/07 but have remained steady over recent years. From
            September 2013 a regulations amendment stated that term time leave
            may only be granted in exceptional circumstances, which explains the
            sharp fall in authorised holiday absence between 2012/13 and
            2013/14.

            The figures in this publication relate to the period after the Isle
            of Wight Council v Jon Platt High Court judgment (which was in May
            2016) where the High Court supported a local magistratesâ€™ ruling
            that there was no case to answer and partially to the period after
            the judgment in the Supreme Court (which was in April 2017) where
            the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that no children should be
            taken out of school without good reason and clarified that
            â€˜regularlyâ€™ means â€˜in accordance with the rules prescribed by the

        <AccordionSection heading="Distribution of absence">
          <p>
            Nearly half of all pupils (48.9 per cent) were absent for five days
            or fewer across state-funded primary, secondary and special schools
            in 2016/17, down from 49.1 per cent in 2015/16.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 per cent of pupil enrolments had more than 25 days of absence in
            2016/17 (the same as in 2015/16). These pupil enrolments accounted
            for 23.5 per cent of days missed. 8.2 per cent of pupil enrolments
            had no absence during 2016/17.
          </p>
          <p>
            Per pupil enrolment, the average total absence in primary schools
            was 7.2 days, compared to 16.9 days in special schools and 9.3 days
            in secondary schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            When looking at absence rates across terms for primary, secondary
            and special schools, the overall absence rate is lowest in the
            autumn term and highest in the summer term. The authorised rate is
            highest in the spring term and lowest in the summer term, and the
            unauthorised rate is highest in the summer term.

          <p>
            The overall absence rates across state-funded primary, secondary and
            special schools were very similar for boys and girls, at 4.7 per
            cent and 4.6 per cent respectively. The persistent absence rates
            were also similar, at 10.9 per cent for boys and 10.6 per cent for

          <p>
            Absence rates are higher for pupils who are known to be eligible for
            and claiming free school meals. The overall absence rate for these
            pupils was 7.3 per cent, compared to 4.2 per cent for non FSM
            pupils. The persistent absence rate for pupils who were eligible for
            FSM was more than twice the rate for those pupils not eligible for
            FSM.
          </p>
          <h3 className="govuk-heading-s">National curriculum year group</h3>

            Pupils in national curriculum year groups 3 and 4 had the lowest
            overall absence rates at 3.9 and 4 per cent respectively. Pupils in
            national curriculum year groups 10 and 11 had the highest overall
            absence rate at 6.1 per cent and 6.2 per cent respectively. This
            trend is repeated for persistent absence.

          <h3 className="govuk-heading-s">Special educational need (SEN)</h3>
          <p>
            Pupils with a statement of special educational needs (SEN) or
            education healthcare plan (EHC) had an overall absence rate of 8.2
            per cent compared to 4.3 per cent for those with no identified SEN.
            The percentage of pupils with a statement of SEN or an EHC plan that
            are persistent absentees was more than two times higher than the
            percentage for pupils with no identified SEN.

          <h3 className="govuk-heading-s">Ethnic group</h3>
          <p>
            The highest overall absence rates were for Traveller of Irish
            Heritage and Gypsy/ Roma pupils at 18.1 per cent and 12.9 per cent
            respectively. Overall absence rates for pupils of a Chinese and
            Black African ethnicity were substantially lower than the national
            average of 4.7 per cent at 2.4 per cent and 2.9 per cent
            respectively. A similar pattern is seen in persistent absence rates;
            Traveller of Irish heritage pupils had the highest rate at 64 per
            cent and Chinese pupils had the lowest rate at 3.1 per cent.

        <AccordionSection heading="Absence for four year olds">
          <p>
            The overall absence rate for four year olds in 2016/17 was 5.1 per

            for the last two years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Absence recorded for four year olds is not treated as 'authorised'

            There is variation in overall and persistent absence rates across
            state-funded primary, secondary and special schools by region and
            local authority. Similarly to last year, the three regions with the
            highest overall absence rate across all state-funded primary,
            secondary and special schools are the North East (4.9 per cent),
            Yorkshire and the Humber (4.9 per cent) and the South West (4.8 per
            cent), with Inner and Outer London having the lowest overall absence
            rate (4.4 per cent). The region with the highest persistent absence
            rate is Yorkshire and the Humber, where 11.9 per cent of pupil
            enrolments are persistent absentees, with Outer London having the
            lowest rate of persistent absence (at 10.0 per cent).
