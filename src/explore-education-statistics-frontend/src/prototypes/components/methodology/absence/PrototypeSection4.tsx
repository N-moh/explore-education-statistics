      <p>
        The school census collects information for a pupil’s absence in the term
        prior to the census i.e. one term in arrears. For example, the spring
        school census collects information on absence during the autumn term.
        Data is collected one term in arrears to ensure all absences are
        accounted for and recorded in each term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the autumn census all schools are required to provide the first
        and second halves of the summer term’s absence figures separately. This
        allows total absence levels to be calculated for both the full year and
        the first five half terms. See the{' '}
