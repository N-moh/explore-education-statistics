      <h3 id="section2-1">2.1 Current termly publications</h3>
      <p>
        DfE publishes termly pupil absence data and statistics via the following
        3 National Statistics releases each year:
      </p>
      <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>autumn term data and statistics - published in May</li>
        <li>
          autumn and spring terms data and statistics - published in October
        </li>
        <li>full year data and statistics - published in March</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only the full year absence release gives a definitive view of pupil
        absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Termly publications can be affected significantly by term length with
        findings from these releases for indicative purposes only and the
        results should be treated with caution.
      </p>
      <p>
        DfEâ€™s annual absence releases have been badged as National Statistics
        since the 1999/00 academic year publication.
      </p>
      <p>
        The termly and 2 term combined releases were badged as National
        Statistics slightly later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combined autumn and spring term release was badged as national
        statistics from the autumn 2006 and spring 2007 publication and the
        single term releases were badged as National Statistics as of the autumn
        term 2009 publication.
      </p>
      <h4>Historical publications</h4>
      <p>
        Prior to the 2012/13 academic year DfE also published spring term only
        absence data. However, this was discontinued as it was deemed no longer
        necessary and of the least importance to users.
      </p>
      <p>The last spring term release wass published on 30 August 2012: </p>
      <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/pupil-absence-in-schools-in-england-spring-term-2012">
            Pupil absence in schools in England: spring term 2012
          </a>{' '}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the 2005/06 academic year, due to the transition of absence
        collection between the Absence in Schools Survey and the school census,
        absence information was published for secondary schools only as a
        National Statistics release.
      </p>
      <p>
        Absence data for 2005/06 were not released on a termly basis as this was
        the first year of collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        For academic years 1999/00 to 2004/05, annual pupil absence information
        was collected via the Absence in Schools Survey and published as an
        annual National Statistics release.
      </p>
      <p>
        For academic years 1993/94 to 1998/99, annual pupil absence information
        was collected via the Absence in Schools Survey and published via
        Statistical bulletins. Links to all absence publications can be found in{' '}
        <a href="#">Annex D</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="section2-2">2.2 Key absence measures</h3>
      <p>
        DfE monitors pupil absence levels using 2 key measures - overall absence
        rate and persistent absence (PA) rate.
