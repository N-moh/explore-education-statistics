<h3 id="fixed-period-exclusion">Fixed-period exclusion</h3>

<p>When a pupil is not allowed to attend (or is excluded from) a school for a set period of time.</p>

<p>This can be for part of a school day and does not have to be for a continuous period.</p>

<p>A pupil can be excluded for 1 or more fixed periods up to a maximum of 45 school days in a single academic year.</p>

<p>This total includes exclusions from previous schools covered by the exclusion legislation so pupils with repeat exclusions can inflate fixed-period exclusion rates.</p>
